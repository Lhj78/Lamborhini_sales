Sales Analytics Dashboard – Project Description

This project is an interactive Sales Analytics Dashboard developed using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit. The dashboard analyzes stock-market–based business data and presents key sales insights in a clear and visual manner.

Since the original dataset does not contain a direct Sales column, a Sales feature is engineered using a price–volume approximation formula derived from existing columns (Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume). This approach simulates real-world sales value and enables meaningful financial analysis.

The dashboard allows users to filter data by date range and dynamically updates all visualizations and metrics. It displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales, and maximum sales. Multiple visualizations are included, such as sales trends over time, monthly sales summaries, sales distribution analysis, volume–sales relationship, and correlation analysis between sales and other numerical features.

The project demonstrates strong skills in:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time-series analysis

Interactive dashboard development

This dashboard is suitable for business analytics, financial data analysis, and portfolio demonstration, showcasing how raw datasets can be transformed into actionable insights using Python.
